Ivy is a job tracking tool created with Django. 
I've created a home page where you can keep track of all the jobs you've applied to. In the form, there is a search/filter dropdown I integrated
with django-select2 to choose the company you are applying to, as well as the current stage and date.

I'm going to try to build a function to automatically scan your email to check the status of jobs, and maybe even add new jobs you've applied to. This will work by checking for emails that say "thank you for applying to xxx" or emails with the keyword hackerrank or something like that.

Initial CSS of the homepage:

I've automated the process of adding companies to the database. There are now around 1400 companies stored in the database.
I've also updated the home page CSS
